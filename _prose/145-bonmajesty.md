# Bonvivant and Majesty  
  
> There was a knock at the door  
  
Rosen, said Pasupe, an event!  
  
Precis the situation, said Rosen.  
  
I hear a knock, said Pasupe.  
Thus, I call.  
I encourage the entry.  
Bonvivant and Majesty appear.  
  
Majesty? Bonvivant? said Rosen.  
  
We met at the Axiom.  
It was but the night before last.  
We went to see Frog Bird.  
  
\*  
  
Transported here upon the shoulders of Majesty, I bestow a terrible burden, said Bonvivant.  
  
The burden is entirely mine, said Bonvivant.  
That might I be less an unworthy conveyance.  
  
\*  
  
We come with tidings from Society, said Bonvivant.  
Society desires your intention.
