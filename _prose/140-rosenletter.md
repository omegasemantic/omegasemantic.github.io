# Rosen, Letter, and Pasupe        
         
> They gazed at Letter; oppressed by its consequence.    
    
Rosen, said Pasupe, this Letter from Authority: I would you offer a morsel of advice.     
        
Define the essence of your dilemma, said Rosen.        
        
Authority desires the status of my situation, said Pasupe.        
        
Does Authority inform why the sudden interest? said Rosen.        
        
The most recent incident gave cause for Authority to come to attention, said Pasupe.        
        
I offer nothing, said Rosen.        
I do not believe in your Authority.        
        
Pasupe replies:         
Yet, here stand you.        
Here stand I.        
There stands Letter.        
Do you imply a manifestation of imagination?        
Should I describe Letter, but lack corporeal evidence, how think you then?        
        
I see what you mean, said Rosen.        
Is existence of Letter a condition for existence of Letter?        
        
These official documents are always so confusing, said Pasupe.
