Jekyll Upgrade Path (lean setup)

1. Includes
   - Put nav, logo, footer in _includes/.
   - One change updates everywhere.

2. Collections
   - Use _examples/ for Example pages.
   - Loop with site.examples for menus.

3. Front matter variables
   - Add metadata per page (title, order, category).
   - Sort or filter loops with these.

4. Custom layouts
   - Create layouts like example.html.
   - Different content types can look different.

5. Assets organization
   - Store CSS, JS, images in assets/.
   - Keep project root tidy.

6. Optional extras
   - Plugins (GitHub Pages safe mode limits apply).
   - SEO tags, sitemap, RSS feed.
