# PROLOGUE  


## EXT. A MAGICAL FOREST SCENE - DAWN.  

### Two fairy children are captured and enslaved  

> We see two FAIRY CHILDREN playing in an idyllic forest glen. Suddenly thunder, lighting, wind. Wolves howl. The light turns orange and red like the fires of hell. An OGRE appears in a lightning flash. The scene is now terrifying, apocalyptic.  


 In a magical forest two children were playing  
The children were fairies, that goes without saying  

But then with a crash and a shriek and a scream  
A storm quite horrendous disrupted the scene  

The onslaughted children who huddled in terror  
Were soon to see worse: THE DIVINE PREDECESSOR!  

A most gruesome ogre who swung a great axe  
To cut on a rope to let drop with a crash  

A rusty old cage, the fairies were trapped  
They tried to break free but the strength for it lacked  

They cried and they moped, alas, without hope  

THE DIVINE PREDECESSOR and all their successors  
Would now own the fairies and rule them forever

# ACT ONE  

##  SCENE 1. EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT  

### A libertine wreaks havoc and is cursed by a ghost  

> Much time has passed. It is many, many generations later. We see a town square, late at night, lit by a street lamp and a few candle lit windows. We see the libertine CHERMIONE mooching by a fountain looking pleased with themselves. ROCOCO cries out from an upstairs window. BELLAMIE runs into the street to confront the criminal!  

Time on time later, too much time to count  
A cry from a window was heard to shout out  

J'accuse! la! J'accuse! Please help me I say!  
ROCOCO was pleading in tones of dismay  

And down on the street with an air bellicose  
CHERMIONE was preening and striking a pose  

# ***  

Then down the stairs with a hat and a sword  
Out ran BELLAMIE. ROCOCO was their ward!  

En garde! I say, dissolute libertine!  
You will taste my blade for the trouble you've been  

The pair fought a duel. BELLAMIE fell bleeding.  
CHERMIONE sneered, saying: What were you thinking?  

### ***  

But up from the body, a SPECTRE now flew  
And said to CHERMIONE: You cur! I CURSE you!  

You come with me now, to Hades, you hound  
You come with me now, you will burn underground!  

The ghost gave a grab on CHERMIONE's arm  
It left a black mark, the mark of the damned!  

### ***  

I care not for your CURSE, said CHERMIONE, in course  

I am not of a mind, it is not in my nature  
To repent, nor reflect on my deeds, now or later  

### ***  

The SPECTRE withdrew but gave one last wail  
My CURSE, you rapscallion has a sting in its tail!  

Should you not repent ere the full moon has bloomed  
Someone you love shall suffer for you!  

### ***  

CHERMIONE said: You impotent ghost  
I could not care less for this other you boast  

### ***  


## SCENE 2. INT. CHERMIONE'S CASTLE - DAWN.  

### The Queen Of The Night gives magical help and Chermione makes a plan to outwit the ghost  

> We are in CHERMIONE's CASTLE. We see CHERMIONE discussing the night's events with their friend DIADEMUS. They command WINKIPOP (the castle JESTER) to summon the QUEEN OF THE NIGHT (a SORCERER in CHERMIONE'S service) for assistance.  

In time came the sunrise. CHERMIONE now leant  
On a friend called DIADEMUS. This is how it went:  

My dearest DIADEMUS, I am cursed something cruel  
You know how I love you, tell me what to do  

DIADEMUS cried: Call THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT!  
They lend such panache, they will set this thing right  

CHERMIONE thus hollered: I summon the Fool!  
WINKIPOP entered and CHERMIONE ruled:  

No time for jest! Hie thee hence from my sight  
If you value your skin fetch THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT!  

### ***  

## JUST MOMENTS LATER ...  

In a puff and a shimmer of green and gold vapour  
THE QUEEN, now appeared, said: Regarding your caper  

I talked to the FATES, this is what to do  
To vanish the CURSE, love a heart that is true  

CHERMIONE, aghast, replied in a panic  
I have never loved! I don't know if I can!  

It is easy to do, said THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT  
LOVE POTION for wooing I hold to my right  

Mayhap it might help if you lived for forever?  
Take my 'LIXIR OF LIFE--You will never find better!  

### ***  

THE QUEEN thus continued: Thou treasure not them?  
Perhaps this enchanted and charmed DIADEM?  

If with this you crown one whose love labours wrong  
C'est la vie, que sera, they will turn to a frog  

### ***  

Choose wisely CHERMIONE, you may not have three  
I will give you but two for your clandestine need  

CHERMIONE responded: LOVE POTION and CROWN  
Would be just the thing when I'm out on the town!  

### ***  

DIADEMUS! Hither thus! CHERMIONE continued  
Announce me a ball and recruit me a retinue  

From those at the ball, I shall choose a mate  
I will wed, lift the CURSE, celebrate, promulgate!  

CHERMIONE gloated, and quick as you like  
WINKIPOP stole THE ELIXIR OF LIFE!  

### ***  

## EXT. DAWN. FOREST  

###  The Evil Twins taunt Vim and The Queen of the Night tries to help  

We are now in the forest. Lo! We meet VIM  
A FAIRY, a CHANGELING, who could not fit in  

Disappointed in love, sometimes dressed in drag  
Afraid of the world that the folk people had  

They were painting a painting with brushes and easel  
When up jumped the TWINS who were spiteful and evil  

They taunted the painter with words and implied:  
VIM wears a look of ambiguous style!  

[TWINS run away laughing]  

# ***  

THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT had been watching invisible  
In a quote: to overhear their conference  

THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT had a generous heart:  
In VIM wished to usher some confidence  

THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT now appeared close to VIM  
And said: Servants they need at the hall  

VIM thus replied: I shall not apply  
I must paint or do nothing at all  

THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT though objected to this  
And said: VIM, you shall go to the ball!  

O, please do not bray, pleaded VIM in dismay  
If you just go away, and I must, I will answer the call  

# ***  

## INT. OR EXT. NIGHT. FESTIVE  

### The Royale Wedding ends badly  

As VIM waited tables, CHERMIONE was able  
To view and indenture a mate  

But their lecherous gaze often landed on VIM  
who amazed at it grew quite irate  

Unwanted advances! They will not be answered!  
But is this a stirring within?  

Said VIM to themselves, then: oh, what the hell  
The wedding is set to begin  

# ***  

In a frenzy of romance, LOVE POTION induced  
The CROWN was emplaced on the CHOSEN ONE's nog  

Exactly as forecast, in less than a pulse  
The CHOSEN ONE turned to a FROG  

# ***  

## EXT. NIGHT. FOREST.  

### Vim and Chermione have an encounter in the forest  

The ball was concluded and back to the forest  
Went VIM to retire and revert  

And under the moon with a bucket and spoon  
Was picking some fruit for dessert  

Along came CHERMIONE, their manner uncouth  
The wedding had not gone to plan  

VIM said: Hello! Perhaps we might dance?  
I have strawberry wine and some jam  

But you have the CURSE? It is spoke on the vine  
Perhaps this is not quite the opportune time?  

CHERMIONE responded: O, I am not fraught  
A trifle, a nothing, not worth second thought  

Then fairy dust fell for no obvious reason  
It was not the season for romantic charms  

And swooning and gaping, without really waiting  
They fell into each others arms  

# ***  

## CONTINUING EXT. NIGHT. FOREST. A LITTLE BIT LATER  

### Diademus causes a terrible scene  

Along came DIADEMUS, who was not impressed  
And said to CHERMIONE: Not quite so repressed?  

To your shame, they went on, this looks horribly wrong  
This union is simply iniquitous  

It is not what it looks like! CHERMIONE rejoined  
And gave VIM a most hurtful rebuff  

I saw what I saw, said DIADEMUS  
I saw what I saw, I saw thus!  

You doubt me my friend?, said CHERMIONE, and then  
Be prepared to defend, with my sword I will satisfy honour  

DIADEMUS parried  
CHERMIONE riposte  
VIM said: I must intervene!  

They formed in a huddle, and inside the muddle  
DIADEMUS died at the scene  

# ***  

CHERMIONE demanding a veil must come down  
Swore VIM to a secretive oath  

Though somewhat deflated, yet slightly elated  
VIM said: Perhaps this is best for us both  


# ACT TWO  

## EXT. DAWN. FOREST.  

### Vim meets a new kind of friend and finds true love at last  

Not long after sunrise, THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT  
Appeared before VIM, who was painting again  

THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT said: Do not be meek  
There is someone nearby I would like you to meet  

Come hither DIAPHANOUS. Come and meet VIM  
A friendship profound I propose to begin  

DIAPHANOUS rose and glid into place  
By a motion unknown to all time and to space  

A transcendent beauty but quite without legs  
And when they arrived THE QUEEN Of NIGHT said:  

DIAPHANOUS here is a creature of light  
They were born but this morning, but ere mid of night  

They must love and be wed or else they will die  
Their reason for being has no alibi  

I swoon at the sight of this magical being, said VIM  
And described in their dreams had been seeing  

A vision of love and for them had been waiting  
The proof of it lies in the scope of my painting!  

And turning the easel, VIM now declared:  
I painted DIAPHANOUS in this vista here!  

I swear my true love for this kind I have sought  
We shall wed tonight, I have no second thoughts!  

THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT said: We must now depart  
But we shall return when the union should start  

# ***  

## CONTINUING DAWN IN THE FOREST.  

### Vim ponders a life or death decision  

Not much too later, a voice could be heard  
WINKIPOP, roaming, was spreading the word  

The word was the news: CHERMIONE will die  
Found guilty of murder, THE GODS have decried  

Ere before long, they will lose their head  
BUT SOMEONE COULD PROXY TO LOSE THEIRS INSTEAD!  


### ***  

Provoked into thought and somewhat agog  
VIM spoke aloud in a short monologue:  

Could I save a soul  
Even CHERMIONE's  

And I did not  
Pleading estrangement  

Could I exist  
In a happy arrangement  

With dearest DIAPHANOUS  
Or with myself?  

It is less of the logic  
And more mental health  

### ***  

VIM reached a conclusion. They summoned their dog  
Who had wings, and could fly, in a pantomime style  

HIKO! Dear HIKO! Hear me now good  
Fly like the wind to the edge of the wood  

To the scene of the slaughter I hope to avert  
Relay to THE GODS I would like to invert  

The sentence they hang over CHERMIONE's head  
And offer my own, p'haps deluded, instead  

### ***  

## EXT. TOWN SQUARE. NIGHT. LIT BY FLAMING TORCHES.  

### Chaos at the execution and Chermione is punished by The Gods  

THE GODS heard the offer, their manner insouciant  
As beings omniscient, they had some presentiment  

CHERMIONE, however, now opened their heart  
Declared a true love and was cleansed of the mark  

And said:  

Distemper the PROXY, O Sagacious Entities!  
Take you now VIM, take thou my dignity!  

Allow in my bosom a chastened heart lie  
But give me a drink, I must be fortified  

[kneels at the chopping block]  

### ***  

Was it nostalgia or was it unkind  
When WINKIPOP offered a strawberry wine?  

Did nobody notice, although in plain sight  
They added a dash of ELIXIR OF LIFE!  

### ***  

Off with their head! THE QUEEN OF HEARTS cried  
Peevish from waiting to utter the line  

They swung with their axe, but the head just grew back  
And SOMEBODY said: That's an anticlimax  

THE QUEEN swung again, once again a resurgence  
THE GODS intervened and said: Given how urgent  

It is they be punished, we can't wait all day  
We strip them of rank and we send them away  

CHERMIONE we banish to exile alone  
In the forest, and no more entitled a throne  

### ***  

## EXT. NIGHT. FOREST. FULL MOON. NEARLY MIDNIGHT.  

### A message is tragically misunderstood and Vim has to make an impossible choice  


HIKO flew home, and thus informed VIM:  
CHERMIONE will live!  
Is the news that I bring  

# ***  

O tragic twist! Reversal!  
VIM misconstrued the message!  


### ***  

HIKO, friend, VIM then said  
Please fly and tell DIAPHANOUS  
I'm sad to say the wedding's off  
Perhaps I am delirious  


### ***  


I am undone, said VIM  

The CURSE is come upon me  


### ***  

To live?  

To love DIAPHANOUS  

To forever know I paid for happiness  

With CHERMIONE's life  

How could I lie in a contented bed  

With that black dagger twisted in my heart  

But to die, and by my act  

Die too my sweet DIAPHANOUS!  

Or, that I would stand?  

To weep in consequence  

Of my immortal thirst  

To lick rancid drops from a liar's cup  

And blind my eyes lest truth's inquiry  

Cracks my mirrored face  

### ***  

O that this dark unfolding scene would be  
Undone; the dreadful conclusion arranged  
Vanished as if dreamed parallels misplaced!  

Lo! Here comes DIAPHANOUS  

### ***  

Have you come to say goodbye? said VIM  

I have, DIAPHANOUS replied  
You know full well I must be gone  
Incarnate I the dying swan  

Thus disappeared DIAPHANOUS  

[DIAPHANOUS dies]  

Expressing tears, VIM said:  

Reflection: untouchable as black night!  
Gross dread unstraightened my soliloquy!  

Now is now  
I will drink this cup  

[drinks poison]  

This liquid death  
Will rip heart  
From life's disease  
And that will be the all  

[dies]  

### ***  

## EXT. DAWN. FOREST GLEN  

> The sun rises to revaeal the lifeless bodies of VIM and DIAPHANOUS. CHERMIONE, now dresed in rags, staggers into view. We  see THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT AND WINKIPOP now dressed with crowns and all the finery of fairy royalty.  

### A miracle happens and all is revealed  

Now we see CHERMIONE, who crawls into the scene  
Now we too see WINKIPOP, and now we see THE QUEEN  

Together they both look, and between them both agree  
CHERMIONE, not so royal now, will no longer be  
The tyrant that had ruled them for all their history  

The line of royals has now been broke  
Not one more successor  
No more for them to be the slaves  
Of EVIL PREDECESSORS  

Then WINKIPOP and QUEEN OF NIGHT  
Conjointly start to chant  

Beloved VIM!  
DIAPHANOUS!  
Return! Return to life!  

[VIM and DIAPHANOUS come back to life]  

### ***  

Hear them! Hear them! Hear them now! A tale of love and glory!  
Hear THE QUEEN and WINKIPOP reveal in full the story!  

# ***  

We were enslaved when but young sprites by the PREDECESSOR  
Please recall the PROLOGUE, this was spoken of much earlier  

In truth are we the monarchs true of whole the fairy realm  
And add to that, you are our spawn, and then to that append  

To keep you safe, most cherished VIM, we hid you far away  
A changeling then, but now again, upon this happy day  

You may blossom! You may bloom! Regain your your rightful place  
A ROYAL TRUE OF FAIRIES be! A smile upon your face!  

Thou dearest soul DIAPHANOUS, a wonder so divine!  
Lend us your grace, be too our child  
Embrace, conjoin, combine!  

### ***  

I am so ripe with pleasure now, they all heard VIM declare  
We must enact the wedding now. All must be prepared!  

Preceding that, a tiny thing, a morsel of an item  
I beg that might you lend to me that charmed enchanted DIADEM  

VIM placed the crown  
On CHERMIONE's head  
They turned into a frog  

And that was ... the end!  

... and they all lived happily ever after!  



## THE END
