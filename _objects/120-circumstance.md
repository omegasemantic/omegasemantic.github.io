# circumstance      
      
I  am a princess, said the princess.      
O holy heck, how I love to dance.      
      
You are a wonderful dancer, I said.      
    
Once upon a time, before this time, before their looks had gone, I had watched the princess dance.      
      
Did you like my dance? said the princess.      
      
I said I did.
