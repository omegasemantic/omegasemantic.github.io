# Rosen, Grep, and Pasupe      
      
> As flashes of bright light flew across the sky, they wondered what the coming days would bring.      
      
Will we be safe now? said Pasupe.      
    
For now, said Rosen.      
      
Did you notice the teeth of the snail? said Pasupe.        
And it moved so fast.      
      
I did.        
We were lucky to make it.        
What can you see?        
      
Not much.        
It is too dark.        
I see an enormous bubble.        
      
A drop of water, said Rosen.      
        
Perhaps it is so.         
Perhaps it is water.         
But will we obtain a drink?        
The exterior is pliant yet I am unable to effect a breach.        
      
I still have my flute, said Rosen.        
I will stop the holes and insert the end of my flute inside.

That's better, said Pasupe.        
I was very thirsty.        
Shall we survive for long?        
      
I hope so, said Rosen.      
We are highly intelligent.       
The danger to us is from insects in the main.       
They have very little brain power.      
      
You offer a fine opinion.       
However, they are extremely predatory and we are very small.      
Where are all the nice creatures?      
Butterflies?      
Friendly nymphs?      
      
I suspect Grep would teach us a lesson, said Rosen.      
      
The lights in the sky.       
What were they? said Pasupe.      
      
Sparks from Grep's grindstone I should think.      
      
They seemed so far away, said Pasupe.      
      
It is funny.      
I lie on my back.      
I look at the moon.      
I look at the sun.      
They look the normal size.      
For a moment I forget.      
      
This is our new reality, said Rosen.      
We have to get used to it.      
      
Change is hard, said Pasupe.
