# : Rosen, Letter, and Pasupe :

Rosen, said Pasupe, this letter from Authority: I would  you offer a morsel of advice.

Describe the essence of your dilemma, said Rosen.

Authority desires the status of my situation, said Pasupe.

Does Authority inform why the sudden interest? said Rosen.

The most recent incident gave Authority cause to come to attention, said Pasupe.

You can put anything you want here.

The cat in the hat.  
Is the cat in the room.  
Such a bad dog.

So cool.

*

Later that night.
