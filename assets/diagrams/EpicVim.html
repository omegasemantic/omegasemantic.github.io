<p>In a magical forest two children were playing <br> The children were fairies, that goes without saying<br></p>
<p>But then with a crash and a shriek and a scream<br> A storm quite horrendous disrupted the scene<br></p>
<p>The onslaughted children who huddled in terror<br> Were soon to see worse: THE DIVINE PREDECESSOR! <br></p>
<p>A most gruesome ogre who swung a great axe<br> To cut on a rope to let drop with a crash<br></p>
<p>A rusty old cage, the fairies were trapped<br> They tried to break free but the strength for it lacked<br></p>
<p>They cried and they moped, alas, without hope<br></p>
<p>THE DIVINE PREDECESSOR and all their successors<br> Would now own the fairies and rule them forever<br></p>

<p>Time on time later, too much time to count<br> A cry from a window was heard to shout out<br></p>
<p>J'accuse! la! J'accuse! Please help me I say! <br> ROCOCO was pleading in tones of dismay<br></p>
<p>And down on the street with an air bellicose<br> CHERMIONE was preening and striking a pose<br></p>
<h1 id="section-5">***<br></h1>
<p>Then down the stairs with a hat and a sword<br> Out ran BELLAMIE. ROCOCO was their ward! <br></p>
<p>En garde! I say, dissolute libertine! <br> You will taste my blade for the trouble you made<br></p>
<p>The pair fought a duel. BELLAMIE fell bleeding.<br> CHERMIONE sneered, saying: What were you thinking?<br></p>
<h1 id="section-6">***<br></h1>
<p>But up from the body, a SPECTRE now flew<br> And said to CHERMIONE: You cur! I CURSE you! <br></p>
<p>You come with me now, to Hades, you hound<br> You come with me now, you will burn underground! <br></p>
<p>The ghost gave a grab on CHERMIONE's arm<br> It left a black mark, the mark of the damned!<br></p>
<h1 id="section-7">***<br></h1>
<p>I care not for your CURSE, said CHERMIONE, in course<br></p>
<p>I am not of a mind, it is not in my nature<br> To repent, nor reflect on my deeds, now or later<br></p>
<h1 id="section-8">***<br></h1>
<p>The SPECTRE withdrew but gave one last wail<br> My CURSE, you rapscallion has a sting in its tail!<br></p>
<p>Should you not repent ere the full moon has bloomed<br> Someone you love shall suffer for you! <br></p>
<p>CHERMIONE said: You impotent ghost<br> I could not care less for this other you boast<br></p>

<p>In time came the sunrise. CHERMIONE now leant<br> On a friend called DIADEMUS. This is how it went:<br></p>
<p>My dearest DIADEMUS, cursed I something cruel<br> You know how I love you, tell me what to do<br></p>
<p>DIADEMUS cried: Call THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT! <br> They lend such panache, they will set this thing right<br></p>
<p>CHERMIONE thus hollered: Summon the Fool! <br></p>
<p>[enter WINKIPOP the jester with antic gestures] <br></p>
<p>No time for jest! Hie thee hence from my sight<br> If you value your skin fetch THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT! <br></p>
<h1 id="section-10">***<br></h1>
<h2 id="moments-later">MOMENTS LATER<br></h2>
<p>In a puff and a shimmer of green and gold vapour<br> THE QUEEN, now appeared, said: Regarding your caper<br></p>
<p>I talked to the FATES, this is what to do<br> To vanish the CURSE, love a heart that is true<br></p>
<p>CHERMIONE, aghast, replied in a panic<br> I have never loved! I don't know if I can! <br></p>
<p>It is easy to do, said THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT<br> LOVE POTION for wooing I hold to my right<br></p>
<p>Mayhap it might help if you lived for forever?<br> Take my ELIXIR OF LIFE--You will not find one better! <br></p>
<p>THE QUEEN thus continued: Thou treasure not them?<br> Perhaps this enchanted and charmed DIADEM?<br></p>
<p>If with this you crown one whose love labours wrong<br> C'est la vie, que sera, they will turn to a frog<br></p>
<p>Choose wisely CHERMIONE, you may not have three<br> I give only two for your clandestine needs<br></p>
<p>CHERMIONE responded: LOVE POTION and CROWN<br> Would be just the thing when I'm out on the town! <br></p>
<h1 id="section-11">***<br></h1>
<p>DIADEMUS! Hither thus! CHERMIONE continued<br> Announce me a ball and recruit me a retinue<br></p>
<p>From those at the ball, I shall choose a mate<br> I will wed, lift the CURSE, celebrate, promulgate! <br></p>
<p>CHERMIONE gloated, and seizing the chance,<br> WINKIPOP stole THE ELIXIR OF LIFE! <br></p>

<p>We are now in the forest. Lo! We meet VIM<br> A FAIRY, a CHANGELING, who could not fit in<br></p>
<p>Disappointed in love, sometimes dressed in drag<br> Afraid of the world that the folk people had<br></p>
<p>They were painting a painting with brushes and easel<br> When up jumped the TWINS who were spiteful and evil<br></p>
<p>They taunted the painter with words and implied:<br> VIM wears a look of ambiguous style! <br></p>
<p>[TWINS run away laughing]<br></p>
<h1 id="section-13">***<br></h1>
<p>THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT had been watching invisible<br> In a quote: to overhear their conference<br></p>
<p>THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT had a generous heart:<br> In VIM wished to usher some confidence<br></p>
<p>THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT now appeared close to VIM<br> And said: Servants they need at the hall<br></p>
<p>VIM thus replied: I shall not apply<br> I must paint or do nothing at all<br></p>
<p>THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT though objected to this<br> And said: VIM, you shall go to the ball! <br></p>
<p>O, please do not bray, pleaded VIM in dismay<br> If you just go away, and I must, I will answer the call<br></p>

<p>As VIM waited tables, CHERMIONE was able<br> To view and indenture a mate<br></p>
<p>But their lecherous gaze often landed on VIM <br> who amazed at it grew quite irate<br></p>
<p>Unwanted advances! They will not be answered! <br> But is this a stirring within?<br></p>
<p>Said VIM to themselves, then: oh, what the hell <br> The wedding is set to begin<br></p>
<h1 id="section-15">*** <br></h1>
<p>In a frenzy of romance, LOVE POTION induced<br> The CROWN was emplaced on the CHOSEN ONE's nog<br></p>

<p>The ball was concluded and back to the forest<br> Went VIM to retire and revert<br></p>
<p>And under the moon with a bucket and spoon<br> Was picking some fruit for dessert<br></p>
<p>Along came CHERMIONE, their manner uncouth<br> The wedding had not gone to plan<br></p>
<p>VIM said: Hello! Perhaps we might dance?<br> I have strawberry wine and some jam<br></p>
<p>But you have the CURSE? It is spoke on the vine<br> Perhaps this is not quite the opportune time?<br></p>
<p>CHERMIONE responded: O, I am not fraught<br> A trifle, a nothing, not worth second thought<br></p>
<p>Then fairy dust fell for no obvious reason<br> It was not the season for romantic charms<br></p>
<p>And swooning and gaping, without really waiting<br> They fell into each others arms<br></p>

<p>Along came DIADEMUS, who was not impressed<br> And said to CHERMIONE: Not quite so repressed?<br></p>
<p>To your shame, they went on, this looks horribly wrong<br> This union is simply iniquitous<br></p>
<p>It is not what it looks like! CHERMIONE rejoined<br> And gave VIM a most hurtful rebuff<br></p>
<p>I saw what I saw, said DIADEMUS<br> I saw what I saw, I saw thus! <br></p>
<p>You doubt me my friend?, said CHERMIONE, and then<br> Be prepared to defend, with my sword I will satisfy honour<br></p>
<p>DIADEMUS parried<br> CHERMIONE riposte<br> VIM said: I must intervene! <br></p>
<p>They formed in a huddle, and inside the muddle<br> DIADEMUS died at the scene<br></p>

<p>Not long after sunrise, THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT<br> Appeared before VIM, who was painting again<br></p>
<p>THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT said: Do not be meek<br> There is someone nearby I would like you to meet<br></p>
<p>Come hither DIAPHANOUS. Come and meet VIM<br> A friendship profound I propose to begin<br></p>
<p>DIAPHANOUS rose and glid into place<br> By a motion unknown to all time and to space<br></p>
<p>A transcendent beauty but quite without legs<br> And when they arrived THE QUEEN Of NIGHT said:<br></p>
<p>DIAPHANOUS here is a creature of light<br> They were born but this morning, but ere mid of night<br></p>
<p>They must love and be wed or else they will die<br> Their reason for being has no alibi<br></p>
<p>I swoon at the sight of this magical being, said VIM <br> And described in their dreams had been seeing<br></p>
<p>A vision of love and for them had been waiting<br> The proof of it lies in the scope of my painting! <br></p>
<p>And turning the easel, VIM now declared:<br> I painted DIAPHANOUS in this vista here! <br></p>
<p>I swear my true love for this kind I have sought<br> We shall wed tonight, I have no second thoughts! <br></p>
<p>THE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT said: We must now depart<br> But we shall return when the union should start<br></p>

<p>Not much too later, a voice could be heard<br> WINKIPOP, roaming, was spreading the word<br></p>
<p>The word was the news: CHERMIONE will die<br> Found guilty of murder, THE GODS have decried<br></p>
<p>Ere before long, they will lose their head<br> BUT SOMEONE COULD PROXY TO LOSE THEIRS INSTEAD! <br></p>
<h1 id="section-20">*** <br></h1>
<p>Provoked into thought and somewhat agog <br> VIM spoke aloud in a short monologue:<br></p>
<p>Could I save a soul<br> Even CHERMIONE's<br></p>
<p>And I did not<br> Pleading estrangement<br></p>
<p>Could I exist <br> In a happy arrangement<br></p>
<p>With dearest DIAPHANOUS<br> Or with myself?<br></p>
<p>It is less of the logic<br> And more mental health<br></p>
<h1 id="section-21">***<br></h1>
<p>VIM reached a conclusion. They summoned their dog<br> Who had wings, and could fly, in a pantomime style <br></p>
<p>HIKO! Dear HIKO! Hear me now good<br> Fly like the wind to the edge of the wood<br></p>
<p>To the scene of the slaughter I hope to avert<br> Relay to THE GODS I would like to invert<br></p>

<p>And said:<br></p>
<p>Distemper the PROXY, O Sagacious Entities! <br> Take you now VIM, take thou my dignity! <br></p>

<p>Off with their head! THE QUEEN OF HEARTS cried<br> Peevish from waiting to utter the line<br></p>
<p>They swung with their axe, but the head just grew back<br> And SOMEBODY said: That's an anticlimax<br></p>
<p>THE QUEEN swung again, once again a resurgence<br> THE GODS intervened and said: Given how urgent<br></p>
