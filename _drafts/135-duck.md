# the journey of duck    
  
> A great wind blew Duck far from land and dropped Duck upon the vastness of the ocean.    
  
Good Feathers! said Duck.    
  
What a calamity!     
  
Duck's beak snapped fast at puny fish swimming by so Duck found food.    
  
But the thirst of Duck could not be quenched.    
  
Then Duck found Rock.    
  
Solitary Duck, said Rock.    
  
Climb me and take a drink of rain from the puddle on my back.    
  
\*  
  
Thank you, Rock, said Duck.    
  
I certainly needed a drink.    
  
Mollymawk zoomed down to shoo Duck off Rock.    
  
Off Rock! Shoo! said Mollymawk.    
  
\*  
  
Back in the ocean, Duck said:    
  
I am caught in an eddy I am sure.    
  
Now I am close to Rock.    
  
Now I am far from Rock.  
  
Now I see front of Rock.    
  
Now I see back of Rock.    
  
But will I never see all my pretty chicks again?    
  
\*  
  
I have much to ponder, said Duck, and only my tiny duck brain to ponder with.    
  
I sense I am self aware.    
  
I appear to recognise a diurnal rotation of the heavens.    
  
Thus, I believe I know a day starts, a day ends, and then a new day begins.    
  
However, I occupy one discrete moment, and then the next.  
  
And within each moment, I have not the slightest notion or sensation of time.    
  
\*  
  
At least I have Rock, said Duck.    
  
I should obtain a drink now and then.    
  
And I can to some extent observe if I am coming or if I am going.    
  
I wonder how long I exist? said Duck.
